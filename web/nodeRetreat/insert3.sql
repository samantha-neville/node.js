We will have demonstrations and optional mini classes throughout the retreat. You can participate in these classes if you wish. We do not include a supply list for these classes because they are smaller and do not require much fabric. You can shop an MSQC shop or browse through one of the area stores. There is always something to do in Hamilton'
