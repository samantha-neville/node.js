A boat that perfectly marries technical boat building with easy to understand techniques - it’s a perfect boat for novices to learn to build for the first time. The boat is made in plywood from a pre-cut kit, which means we can get the boat built comfortably in the week. Unlike other plywood boats, we use timber rather than fibreglass to join the panels, which makes for a much nicer build process and a broader range of skills to learn.'
